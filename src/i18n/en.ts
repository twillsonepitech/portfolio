    description: "I started coding in high school, not knowing what to do with my life, and I immediately loved the idea of creating things through programming. Later, I joined Epitech, a school 100% focused on computer science and coding. Passionate about programming, Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and explore new ways to approach a project. I love the thought that I can create anything I imagine, as long as I have a keyboard in my hands.",
